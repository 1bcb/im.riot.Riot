This is a community-maintained [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) distribution of [Element Desktop](https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/), [formerly](https://element.io/previously-riot) called Riot.

## User-specified config.json

Element Desktop's [instructions](https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/#user-specified-configjson) do not apply. Instead, `config.json` must be created at `~/.var/app/im.riot.Riot/config/$NAME/config.json`, where `$NAME` is typically `Element`.
